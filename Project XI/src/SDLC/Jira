--->> 
--->> 
--->> 

===^_^===>>> link
--->> related user stories with test cases
--->>

--->> duplicate it, clone test case ticket or execution ticket
--->> why, say there are multiple tests in test execution type

	  that's why clone it, clone and assign it to other testers
	  so they can also execute the tests at the same time frame
	  
	  clone so many can work on single issue within a single project.
	  cloned issues can be linked together.

===^_^===>>> peer review? for regression
--->> double check the test case
--->> before you execute, make sure test cases understandable
	if asked in interview, say yes we do peer review frequently
	to double check our cases


===^_^===>>> as a tester, we must know how to create

--->> test --> test execution, -->Bug --> Test in cucumber
