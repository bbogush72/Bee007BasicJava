Agile Development;
==================
==Scrum is like a time box, a sprint;
==Scrum is Agile process;
==Focus on delivering the highest business;
==With a short amount of time;
== Every 2-4 weeks, see the working product.

==^^==

==Scrum operates fast and repeatedly;
==Inspection on working product every 2-4 weeks
==The business sets the goals
==Team self organize and determine highest quality the best way 

==^=^==

Every 2-4 weeks everyone can see the working product
Then decide to release or postpone in another sprint


==^=^==Scrum Framework;
Everything start at product backlog; like a big box, gather
everything to be developed
such as idea of the customer; all functionalities here;

==Sprint planning is next; where backlog broken down
==Sprint backlog; small part of backlogs decided in the planning meeting

==Scrum team: testing features

==Next; Sprint review;
Start another sprint to fill the increment box.
Every single sprint not release product
3-4 months, after 6 sprints
==Increment

==^=^==
before product released, regression testing done.
then return to new sprint

==^=^== Sequential vs Overlapping(Agile Scrum)

Scrum teams do little of everything always.
or
sequential one thing at a time

==^=^==Parts of Scrum framework
roles: 

product owner=internal
Scrum master =internal
tester  = internal scrum
developer = internal scrum

===^^=== External parts of projects

business owner = external scrum
Stakeholder = external scrum
SME = subject matter expert = external scrum
they are not involved in the internal part

ceremonies

artifacts

==^=^==huh! did not review ceremonies and artifacts as of yet!



==^=^==Scrum team characteristics
Self organize team
Product progress in series of a month long Sprint
Requirement are gathered as items in product backlog
No specific engineer practices prescribed, depends on the team
Use a generative rules to create an agile environment for delivery
Agile process that is after all


==^=^== Product Owner
== defines features of the product
== decide on the release date
== is responsible for the backlog and maximize the product(ROI)
== prioritize the features based on market value
== adjust features and priority every iteration as needed
==accept or reject work results;

==^=^==Scrum Master(SM)
you have access to laptop, tools provided by SM;
if you cannot access, you cannot start working;
SM help facilitate this type of issues.
SM is not technical person but SM will find the easiest way;
solve your impediments, access issues.
SM do meetings;
product owner cannot be  SM;


SM;
Responsible for the Scrum process;
Removed impediment;
Facilitates scrum events;
Facilitates communication;


==^=^==Development team (not developers!!!);
Who work on project can be in dev team;
The team creates the product;
product owner and scrum master cannot be in dev team;


==^=^==Business Owner BO;
Set up framework for Scrum team with organization;
provides assistance and resources;
higher level then product owner;
not every company may have BO;

sometimes BO works with SM to remove impediments;
lead Stake-holder;


==^=^==Stake-holder;
==is who invested in the project;
==see the value of production at every sprint;
==


==^=^==Sprint;

==Sprint is one time box; progress in series of sprints
==in this time box; iteration of development life cycle;

==product is designed, coded and tested during the sprint;
==typical duration 2-4 weeks;

==it can be 1 week if the team is fast and/or environment great
==it can be 3 weeks too, depends
==


==^=^== Sprint Planning

==Sprint planning followed by sprint and daily stand up meetings
==there is retrospective meeting and  review meeting which
decides the end of sprint


=======Sprint planning meeting================================
Sprint goal where analyze and evaluate backlog products
Select a sprint goal

Decide how to achieve sprint goal
create a sprint backlog(tasks) items like user stories/features
Estimate sprint backlog in hours

product owner work with the team and negotiate and finalize 
the definition of completed story
so where stories for sprint are established here;
sprint goal is agreed here;
ready to start sprint

==^=^==no changes during a sprint, if sprint started;=========
do not make changes in the sprint, 
we can change after the sprint

======================================================
capacity and velocity are the terms 
that tester or another determine their doable tasks
======================================================



==^=^==Daily Scrum / Stand Up meeting

==not for problem solving;
==the entire team is there; including SM, PO and team members
==a sidebar conversation is taken offline, 
	it follows the daily meeting and include team members
	regarding the topic at hand;
	
	Are we meeting the deadline? type meeting;
	
	if you say let's talk offline; 
	then you refer to meeting after daily scrum meeting;

==^=^== Everyone answers 3 question

make sure everyone working on a task;
== what did you do yesterday?
== what will you do today?
== What impediments are standing in you way?


==^=^== Sprint review meeting;
==team demonstrates accomplished tasks
== like a demo of new features
== stakeholders see the demo^^ ^^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^^ 
== PO, SM, Dev Team and SME who build the product
== product owner may present, or developers or even testers
==ScrumMaster facilitates any dialogue;
==Scrum team has a rare opportunity with face to face with stakeholders
==can learn hoe to receive feedback,

==^=^== Sprint Retrospective Meeting;
== Learn good things in trials and repeat them, and improve on;
== The entire team including ScrumMaster and Product Owner joins this meeting;
==This meeting done after every sprint;

While we work on sprint 2, there can be retrospective meeting;
for the previous meeting.


==^=^== Questions discussed in Retrospective meeting;
== What went well?
== What did not go well?
== What could be improved in the next sprint?

==^=^== 3 Amigo meeting;
==3 Amigo are BA, testers and developers get together;
==informal meeting;
==talk about user story and acceptance criteria;
==functionality == developer's thing
