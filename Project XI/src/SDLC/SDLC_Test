Reproduce : as long as a tester found a bug, he/she will recreate a bug a couple times to make sure it is a valid bug or not.

Status: fixed = "in QC"; ready for testers

New : given by QA and all new defect is given as new

Assigned: bug is posted by tester, to the development team, but not solved yet!

=================================================================================================================================
Defect Life Cycle Status: 

Rejected: developers decide to make it reject it, if the defect is not valid.

Not a bug: if the functionality of the application do not change, then status is assigned to "Not a Bug"

Duplicate: if a defect repeated twice or defect is related to the same concept, the status changed to "duplicate"

Deferred: if the bug is not part of a prime priority, then it's deferred to be fixed in next release

Closed: testers cancel the bug, or close it.
==================================================================================================================================



QA =verification, ensuring the quality of process.

QC = validation, ensuring that the product meets client expectation.

POS manager should be able to create new products.

Severity is the degree of impact caused by a Defect  on development or operation in a component being testing.

QA engineer == Tester; determines the severity level of the defect.

====Defect Severity Level===================================================

Critical: a complete shut-down.

Major: highly severe defect, it collapses the system. Certain system parts remains functional.

Medium: System is a functional; but this type defect causes unwanted behavior.

Minor: It doesn't cause any major break-down.

======================================================

Priority of defect: Developers or Product Owner decide on the priority of defect fix

Priority Levels :
High===> The defect must be solved asap since system cannot operate without this fix.
Medium===> During the normal course of development activities, the defect should be resolved.
Low====> It's a very minimal fix, and this can be fixed when more serious defects are fixed.

Medium and high priorities should be fixed in a timely manner.


=============Examples===================
